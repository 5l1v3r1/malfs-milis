Notes
=====

You must have ``CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST`` enabled in your kernel
for several of the go tests to pass and the buidl to
succeed.

You probably want to ensure you have
the following setup either temporarily
in your ``$HOME/.bashrc`` or ``$HOME/.profile``
or ``/etc/profile`` or similar.

.. code-block:: sh
    
    export GOROOT=/usr/lib/go
