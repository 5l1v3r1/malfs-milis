NOTE: this Build (originaly made for Slackware) is a monster 
it tries to wrap all dependencies to
vlc into the resulting package by building these deps as static libraries
and then in the final stage linking vlc against all the static libraries.
The resulting package has all the vlc functionality and does not depend on
any software that is not present in a standard full install of Slackware.
This makes my package quite different from all the other vlc builds that are
floating around on the Internet.
